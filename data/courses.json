There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. ",
            "Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements is called a linear data structure."

The modem allowed digital data to be transmitted over regular unconditioned telephone lines at a speed of 110 bits per second (bit/s)."
